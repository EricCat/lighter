This is a marked down test post. I want to test the capability of marked down and see how it works in the wild.

#Getting started

We want to find a new way to write IOS products. The first thing is to start is by interface builder.

* Display different images for different rows – lastly, we display the same thumbnail for all rows. Wouldn’t be better to show individual image for each recipe?
* Get a developer license
* Start developing.

Location services provide a way to improve your app by enhancing the user experience. If you’re developing a travel app, you can base on the users’ current location to search for nearby restaurants or hotels. 

You can also find the location feature in most of the Photo apps that saves where the pictures are taken. The Core Location framework provides the necessary Objective-C interfaces for obtaining information about the user’s location. With the GPS coordinate obtained, you can make use of the API to decode the actual street or utilize the Map framework to further display the location on Map.
